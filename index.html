                <p>This is the first piece I composed. I learned Schubert's Ständchen when I was a kid and have always had a strong love for this piece. Every time 
                    I heard it I always heard this other melody in my head that went right along with it. Then I happened to hear it a few years ago and thought to 
                    myself, "now is the time buddy". So, I tried my hand at composing and arranging and this is what came of it.</p>

                <p>This piece is based off of a warmup we used to do in HS band. Everyone plays the first note in uninson, then the second, but on the 
                    third note, it splits and the second section starts over on the first note again. This happens again when note 5 is hit, the third 
                    section starts over at the beginning. The pattern is akin to singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" as a round between three people.</p>

                <p>This song is special. I took a piece of paper and drew two rectangles side by side. Then, I wrote out the scale of notes 
                    from A to G: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A at the top. I then asked my bf to pick any letter(s) they wanted, in any order, and 
                    write four letters in each rectangle. The only stipulation was <b>not</b> to spell words (FACE or ACE, etc). I took 
                    those eight notes and this is what came of it.</b></p>

                <p>Gabriel Fauré's <b><i>Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50</i></b> is one of my ultimate faves. The haunting color of it just makes 
                    me feel at home. True to my brain, when I hear this song I also hear another melody in my head that fits with it so well. 
                    This is what came of it.</p>

            <p>Krystifer is a classically trained pianist and composer whose music speaks the truths words often fail to. Born August 28, 1980, and shaped by a unique neurodivergent lens—including ADHD and autism—he crafts soundscapes that merge emotion with structure, chaos with clarity.<br>
            <br>Deafness arrived unexpectedly, but rather than ending his musical journey, it transformed it. As both a composer and producer, Krystifer continues to create deeply expressive works—anchored in physics, science, and a relentless curiosity for how the universe feels.<br>
            <br>Grounded in a love for animals, close friendships, and a steadfast belief in justice, his compositions are reflections of a world he hopes to see: one rooted in equality, access, and truth. His influences span from Chopin to Carl Sagan, with no patience for political games, prejudice, or apathy. Krystifer loves dogs, a recent convert to the joys of cats, science, physics, and the unexpected beauty of human connection.</p>
